<div class="Article-bodyContent">
<p>Last season&#8217;s Baltimore Ravens never <a href="https://inte.linvosges.com/">quite hit their stride</a>. They alternated wins and losses for the first six weeks of the year, and by the time they won four consecutive games after that, they were dealing with a mess of injuries that eventually slowed them down toward the end of the season and resulted in a 10-7 finish.</p>
<p>Baltimore still made the playoffs, but lost in the wild card round to the division rival Cincinnati Bengals. Looking ahead into 2023, things should be better for the Ravens. Health alone should lead to improvement, and the change to Todd Monken at offensive coordinator should as well.</p>
<p>But the defense is likely still the best unit on the team, and one of the stars of that unit &#8212; linebacker Roquan Smith, acquired at least year&#8217;s trade deadline &#8212; sees bright things in its future.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m just excited to get out there and fly around with the guys, because I think we&#8217;re in for something special,&#8221; Smith said, per the team&#8217;s official website. &#8220;And I think myself, personally, I think it&#8217;s going to be probably my best year, at least the way I feel physically and mentally.&#8221;</p>
<p>Smith indicated that he and the team want to go right at the Bengals, who have now won the AFC North in back to back seasons. &#8220;We want all the smoke, honestly,&#8221; Smith said. &#8220;There&#8217;s a lot of payback that we have out there. We&#8217;ll get to it when we get to it, one week at a time.&#8221;</p>
<div id="article-body-ad-1" class="gambling-partner-ad"></div>
<p>The Ravens don&#8217;t play the Bengals in Week 1, but they don&#8217;t have to wait much longer than that. What should be one of the most anticipated rivalry games of the season is set for Week 2, when the Ravens travel to Cincinnati. The late-season rematch in Baltimore will take place on Thursday Night Football the week before Thanksgiving. Hopefully for the viewing public&#8217;s sake, we get healthy teams on both sides of the ball, and two entertaining matchups.</p>

<p>Every January, the NFL playoffs are dotted with teams that have made a significant improvement on one side of the ball. Whether it&#8217;s an offensive revolution sparked by the emergence of a dynamic quarterback or a defensive flourish fueled by the formation of a ferocious front, postseason tournament bids often spawn from one rising unit inducing the transition from pretender to contender.</p>
</div>
<div class="nfl-c-body-part nfl-c-body-part--text">
<p>As a scout with the Carolina Panthers in the 2000s, I watched a perennial underdog suddenly make a Super Bowl run behind a substantially improved defense. Driven by a mix of blue-chippers and no-names playing outstanding football from Week 1 on, Carolina&#8217;s D battered and bruised opponents with an ultra-physical approach. The core of that group was a nasty front seven featuring Julius Peppers, Kris Jenkins, Mike Rucker, Dan Morgan and Mike Minter (in a box-safety role).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">LEBANON, Tenn. — AJ Allmendinger pulled away from the field on the second overtime to win Saturday’s Xfinity Series race at Nashville Superspeedway and claim his second victory of the year.</p>
<p>Allmendinger’s win snapped the <a href="https://inte.linvosges.com/">streak of 11 consecutive</a> different winners this season.</p>
<p>Riley Herbst, working with new crew chief Davin Restivo in a change made this week, finished second to tie his career series best. Sam Mayer placed third and was followed by Austin Hill and Josh Berry in a race that had 11 cautions and 21 cars involved in accidents.</p>
<h3></h3>
<p class="p1">Allmendinger passed Parker Kligerman for the lead with 11 laps left in the scheduled distance as Kligerman tried to save fuel. A caution for Chad Chastain’s spin sent the race into overtime. Contact on the restart led to Chandler Smith spinning. That set up the second overtime restart.</p>
<p>There were three cautions in the first 20 laps for multi-car accidents.</p>

<p>The field failed to complete a lap before a five-car incident in Turn 2 that collected Justin Allgaier, who entered the race third in the points. Shortly after the race restarted, the caution came back out again for an incident that included Hill bouncing off the wall. Hill entered the race second in the points.</p>
<p>The start of the second stage had a caution almost immediately. Hill, who was on older tires, slid up into Ty Gibbs, triggering an incident that collected Allmendinger and Carson Hocevar, ending Hocevar’s race. Hill was on older tires because he had put on new tires earlier after he was involved in an incident early in the first stage. With limits on tires, Hill’s team did not pit for tires at the end of the first stage. He moved to the lead when the rest of the field pitted during the stage break.</p>
<p><strong>STAGE 1 WINNER: </strong>Ty Gibbs</p>
<p><strong>STAGE 2 WINNER: </strong>Chandler Smith</p>
<p><strong>WHO HAD A BAD RACE: </strong>Stefan Parsons was collected in an accident on the opening lap and finished last. … After winning the first stage, Ty Gibbs was collected in a crash and finished 36th.</p>
<p><strong>NOTABLE: </strong>There were five cautions for multi-car crashes in the first two stages of the race. There had been five cautions for multi-car crash in the previous five races combined. … The 11 cautions tied an event record.</p>
<p><strong>NEXT: </strong>The series races July 1 on the Chicago street course (5 p.m. ET on USA Network)</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<article id="article-body" class="w-full main-content__body main-content__body--drop-letter">CROMWELL, Conn. — Keegan Bradley shot a 6-under 64 on Saturday to <a href="http://inte.linvosges.com">break the tournament</a> 54-hole scoring record at 21 under in the Travelers Championship, while Rickie Fowler had the second 60 of the week at TPC River Highlands.The previous three-round mark was 18 under, set by Brendon Todd on an empty course during the height of the pandemic in 2020. The four-round tournament record is 22 under, set by Kenny Perry in 2009.Bradley missed a 20-foot putt on 18 that would have tied the PGA Tour’s 54-hole mark of 188 set by Steve Stricker in the 2010 John Deere Classic and matched by Justin Thomas in the 2017 Sony Open. Bradley opened with rounds of 62 and 63.</p>
<p>“I’ve wanted to win this tournament forever,” said Bradley, a Vermont native who also lived in Massachusetts and was playing in front of a large contingent of family and friends. “So, the feeling of wanting to push and win is something I need to fight against<a href="https://inte.linvosges.com/"> and just let myself</a> go out and play.”</p>
<p>Chez Reavie was a shot back after a 63. He led for much of the back nine, but made a bogey on the par-3 16th, while Bradley hit his tee shot to 6 feet and converted the birdie putt for a two-stroke swing. Bradley finished second to Reavie in the 2019 Travelers.</p>
<p>“I had a big lead and then Keegan made a bunch of birdies throughout the beginning and middle part of the round to make it really close,” Reavie said. “Tomorrow is going to be the opposite. It’s going to be a shootout.”</p>
<p>Fowler just missed the 13th sub-60 round in Tour history. After failing to convert from just off the green on his final hole, he wound up tied for fourth at 15 under in the event where Jim Furyk shot a Tour-record 58 in 2016.</p>
<p>“I hit a decent chip, just hit it a little soft,” Fowler said. “A tap in for 60 is never a bad thing. It’s better than a 61.”</p>

<h1 class="headline">After 62 at the U.S. Open, Fowler flirts with 59</h1>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Last week, Rickie Fowler shot the first 62 in U.S. Open history. This week, he flirted with his first 59 on the PGA Tour.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Fowler was a shot behind Patrick Cantlay, who had a bogey-free 61 that included five birdies on his final seven holes. Cantlay was the first player to shoot a 60 on this course, doing it as a 19-year-old amateur in 2011.</p>
<p>“The scoring on this golf course is usually on the back nine in that middle stretch,” he said. “I played the front nine 4 under. If you can get the front nine you can shoot a real low one, so tomorrow with the scores low I imagine it’ll take another low one.”</p>
<p>Denny McCarthy opened with a 60 on Thursday and shared the second-round lead with Bradley at a tournament-record 125.</p>
<p>McCarthy fell back early Saturday, making three bogeys on the front nine for a 37. He shot 70, leaving him tied with Fowler and Adam Scott (65).</p>
<p>An almost half inch of rain delayed the start to the round until 11 a.m., with players going off in threesomes on both front and back nine. But it also kept the greens soft and the scoring low.</p>
<p>Fowler, who shot the first 62 in U.S. Open history last week, had seven birdies on his first 11 holes Saturday.</p>
<p>He was at 7 under on the par-5 sixth hole when he hit a little chip shot from 60 feet that bounced onto the green and rolled straight into the hole for an eagle.</p>
<p>Thomas also put himself in contention Saturday with a 62, leaving him in a group at 14 under.</p>
<p>“I’ve felt very close for a while, just have had literally nothing to show for it,” Thomas said. “And you never know. I’m one round away tomorrow from kind of completely changing my focus and outlook on the year and the rest of the year.”</p>
<p>Top-ranked Scottie Scheffler shot a 63 and was also in that group.</p>
<p>U.S. Open champion Wyndham Clark had a 67 to get to 8 under.</p>
